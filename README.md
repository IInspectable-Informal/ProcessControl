## üì¶ Repository Structure

- **Main Branch (C Implementation)**:
  - Production-ready C version with cross-platform compatibility
  - Located in root directory (`ProcessControl.c`)

- **Experimental/ASM Branch**:
  - High-performance x64 assembly implementation
  - Located in `src/ProcessControl.asm`
  - For research/optimization purposes only

## üìñ Technical Overview

Provides low-level Windows process control through two implementations:

### Core Functions
```c
BOOL SuspendProcess(DWORD pid);  // Suspends all threads of a process
BOOL ResumeProcess(DWORD pid);   // Resumes all threads of a process
```

### Key Differences
| Feature          | C Version               | ASM Version               |
|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Architecture     | Multi-arch compatible  | x64 optimized            |
| Stability        | Production-ready       | Experimental            |
| Use Case        | General purpose        | Performance-critical    |
